## DevOps22 - GitHub Contributions

A fun project counting the GitHub contributions of the DevOps22 students. The script is run every day at 00:00 and the results are saved in a JSON file. The script also generates a Pie Chart with the Top 5 students with the most contributions. More to come... ðŸ™‚

## Battleship

A simple Battleship game made using Pygame. The game is played against AI. The AI is not very smart, but it is fun to play against it. The game is played on a 10x10 grid. The player and the AI have 5 ships each. The player can place the ships manually or randomly. The AI places the ships randomly. The player and the AI take turns shooting at each other's ships. The first one to sink all the opponent's ships wins.

## Python Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path, in the example below, a directory named .venv

It is recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications. This keeps the dependencies required by different projects in separate places by creating virtual Python environments for them. It keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.

### Step 1 - Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### Step 2 - Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3 - Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
