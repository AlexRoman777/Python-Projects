# DevOps22 GitHub Contribution

A fun project counting the GitHub contributions of the DevOps22 students. Hope this will motivate you to contribute more to GitHub.

How it looks like:

<img src="img/top5.png" alt="Pie Chart" width=20%/>

## How it works

The script does't use the GitHub API. Instead it uses the GitHub website to get the contributions of the students. It uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to get the HTML code of the GitHub profile page and parse it to get the contributions.

---

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Run the script

## What I learned

- How to use the `requests` library to get the HTML code of a website
- How to use the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse HTML code
- Unfortunatly not everybody is using GitHub much... ðŸ˜•

## TODO

- [ ] Add matplotlib to show the contributions in a bar chart
- [ ] Use the GitHub API to get the contributions, when the package gets fixed
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions to run the script every day and update the README.md file
- [x] Add a pie chart with the top 5 students
